# cx_Oracle version 7.0

cx_Oracle is a Python extension module that enables access to Oracle
Database.  It conforms to the [Python database API 2.0
specification][1] with a considerable number of additions and a couple
of exclusions.  See the
[homepage](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/index.html) for a
feature list.

cx_Oracle 7 has been tested with Python version 2.7, and with versions
3.5 and higher. You can use cx_Oracle with Oracle 11.2 and higher client
libraries (including Oracle 18.3). Oracle's standard client-server version
interoperability allows connection to both older and newer databases,
for example Oracle 18.3 client libraries can connect to Oracle
Database 11.2.
